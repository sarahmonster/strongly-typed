Companies are not your friend. They don't need you to root for them. They are
very big, and wanting to like them by default is giving them too much credit.

Thanks to businesses' presence on social media, people "connect" more with
brands. Apple and Breville are anthropomorphised to be more than the makers of
tin cans of various sizes that send email or toast bread--they're our friends!
They're someone we interact with every day when we check our Twitter feed,
use our phones, drive our cars, or make our frozen pizzas. They help us get
shit done.

We *like* them.

We talk about them as if they are people, as if they can be summed up quickly
into a company we like or of which we are disapproving. But that isn't an
accurate portrait of how we actually interact with companies. We buy their
products or not; we believe in an organization's missions or we don't. We may
even have a great track record buying Honda cars or Rockport shoes, but it's
not the same as having a friend you like. It is, perhaps, a company you trust.

But implicit trust of an entity that exists solely to get your money strikes me
as somewhat misplaced.

## Why Do We Personify?

A business' name is thrown in our face more and more: advertisements online
and offline; sponsored tweets, Facebook posts, YouTube videos, etc. And our
relationships with companies and usage of their products outlive the people at
said companies. It's useful to think of us as having a relationship with these
businesses. I don't think of my phone as being a "[Kazuo Hirai][] phone":
it's a **Sony** phone!

So I get why we begin to personify these companies; we interact with them often
and in sometimes very meaningful ways. We want to attach meaning to the time
and effort we spend with these brands. The people who profess that they *love
Honda* are probably crazy, but their feelings are understandable, even if odd.

## The Projection

What gets confusing is when a company **does something you don't like**:
suddenly you've got a friend you thought you knew who suddenly told you they're
voting Republican or that they read Twilight. You wonder how you can like a
company anymore now that they've released a bad product, or one you disagree
with.

The same car company that sold the gas-guzzling [Hummer][] sells the
[Chevy Volt]. It gets complicated thinking of these huge entities as people we
can blanket like or dislike. They're hyper-focused on their markets (unlike
most people, who hopefully are more nuanced and well-rounded).

I might like motorcycles and people who like them. I generally loathe it when
people talk shit about motorcycles. Chevy doesn't make motorcycles--do I
interpret this as them disliking bikes, and now dislike them on principle?

I *want to like* them because they make the Volt, an eco-friendly car. What am
I to do?

## Principle

Ultimately, I think _**wanting** to like or dislike a company_ misses the point.
These are businesses and they aren't designed to be *liked*.
They're around to make products that you use. Having an allegiance
to a company is different than them having a track record. Liking Apple products
is different than **liking Apple**. Don't confuse the two.

This goes similarly for mission-driven organizations (like my employer,
[Mozilla][]). Recently a Mozilla-published news site
[stirred up controversy][tos-apologies] by publishing
[an article](https://openstandard.mozilla.org/yes-gamergate-is-everyones-issue/)
outlining that the trolling from "Gamergate" was aimed at pretty much everyone.

What surprised me was people responding to this by saying that they wanted
Mozilla to make their stand clear because they *like Mozilla*. They didn't want
to feel betrayed by someone they liked. I understand that notion, and I
fully advocate holding companies responsible for their actions. But I think we
need to be careful about how we frame our concern for a company's actions.
I want a company to do the right thing, but I don't value Mozilla's mission
to fight for the open web less because they did a [tangentially bad thing][].

Mozilla's mission may be one I agree with, they may be my employer, and we
may have a friendly relationship, but **we are not _friends_**. Mozilla is a
large and complex organization, and I can more accurately attribute what they
do to a distributed and various group of people (and laws!) than to one entity.
I don't *like Mozilla*, I like what they stand for--but they aren't the only
ones who stand for it.

## It's Like That

It's futile to think of organizations as one entity you can simply like or
dislike. They are way more complex than default approval or disapproval, which
is dangerous anyway (see: politics in the USA).

And these companies are *huge*. They don't need you to root for them.
Mozilla is the underdog in a fight for open standards, but that doesn't mean
it warrants your support by default on every issue. It's not some scrappy
start-up that needs your love to survive. It needs action. You don't have to
like them, you just need to support the good they do.

So stick to liking your friends, using your phone, and being--by
default--suspicious of business. They don't deserve the likes of us.
