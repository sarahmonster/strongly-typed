CEOs need to lead; to make decisions. That's their role in an organization: to
be a singular decision-maker when group consensus won't do the job. Mozilla is
a big company and an [even bigger community](https://mozillians.org/), so
having someone around who can think at a high level and make executive
decisions is important. It keeps the company clear of circular discussions or
group paralysis. I think Mozilla is without a CEO today because our former CEO,
Brendan Eich, failed in his job as CEO--not because of his donation in
support of Prop 8.

[Brendan Eich stepped down as CEO at Mozilla today](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/04/03/brendan-eich-steps-down-as-mozilla-ceo/), seemingly
in response to calls for him to resign over
[his stance against gay marriage](http://projects.latimes.com/prop8/donation/8930/).
[The mob](http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/03/gay-firefox-developers-boycott-mozilla-to-protest-ceo-hire/) might think that they've "won"; a lot of community members
and [press](http://www.mercurynews.com/60-second-business-break/ci_25486642/biz-break-mozilla-ceo-steps-down-after-prop) already interpret this development as Eich stepping
down in direct response to his support of Prop 8, but I think it's more
nuanced than that.

## The Face of the Company

<img id="the-bobs" src="{{ site.url }}/images/the-bobs-office-space.jpg" alt="The Bobs, from the movie Office Space" title="What would you say, you do here?" class="photograph">The title CEO stands for Chief **Executive** Officer--a CEO's job is to make
decisions; to _execute_. Though Eich's stance on gay marriage is something
I find exclusionary and generally _awful_ as a queer guy, I don't think it's why
he can't be Mozilla's CEO. While I would prefer my company's CEO be socially
progressive, Eich's battle is [already lost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_California) and he has never injected his views into company
culture, hiring practices, or community discussions. For Mozilla, a company
whose mission I care deeply about, I want a leader who can make tough decisions,
be mindful of the future, and run a company well more than anything.

Being on the losing side of history this one time is okay, because I've seen
Eich be right about many things during just my tenure at Mozilla. He's [wrote eloquently on issues affecting the web](https://brendaneich.com/2013/02/why-mozilla-matters/)
and [Mozilla's interactions with closed standards](https://brendaneich.com/2012/03/video-mobile-and-the-open-web/). He is technically thoughtful and experienced. I would say his
overall track record coming in as CEO was **solid**.

What made me realize he was not ready to lead Mozilla--or any company--was his
[damage control article on CNET](http://www.cnet.com/news/mozilla-ceo-gay-marriage-firestorm-could-hurt-firefox-cause-q-a/).

## The Correct Answer was "Yes"

There was a lot of discussion inside the Mozilla community regarding the
community sentiment and press articles--many of whom equated Eich with Mozilla,
leaving many Mozillians--feeling like they were being attacked
for a belief held by their CEO. Speaking for myself, it was frustrated being
painted with the same brush as Eich--I'm a bisexual guy who works at a company
that promotes total freedom on the Internet (and thus in some ways the world).
Being labelled as someone who works for an anti-LGBT company stung a bit.

In the CNET interview, when asked what his current views on gay marriage are,
Eich dodges the question. When asked if he could do it all over again, knowing
what he knows now and what the backlash against Mozilla would be, he does
not answer that he would do things differently. He also refuses to commit to be
clearly _against_ gay marriage, instead reiterating his party line of "let's
leave our personal opinions at the door." If that were possible, we wouldn't
still be in this situation a week and a half after his promotion to CEO was
announced.

Eich was given the clear chance to publicly apologize on behalf of himself and
Mozilla--something called for by many, including myself, for him to do. When
asked if he could do it all over and do it different:
[the correct answer was "yes"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BWJFnLjZGo).
But he didn't. He didn't fail as CEO until that point.

## The Result

Anyone reading the article would not walk away with a clearer picture of Eich's
thoughts on gay marriage, his Prop 8 donation, or inclusiveness at Mozilla.
That CNET article was his chance to apologize, to make things right, and to
speak on behalf of Mozilla--as its newly-minted CEO, not as Brendan Eich.

Unfortunately, he failed to execute.

Eich did not move the needle forward, advance the discussion, or put the issue
to rest in that article. In his first test as CEO of Mozilla, he **failed to
execute**. So while I think his donation to Prop 8 spurred the controversy and
exposed his inability to think as _Mozilla's CEO_ instead of as _Brendan Eich_,
I don't think it was his stance against gay marriage in his home state
of California that should be looked to as the cause for his departure.

## "Conflicted"

I've already noticed many of my colleagues expressing their conflicted feelings
about Eich's resignation. To me, there is no conflict, though perhaps some
disappointment.

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/mozlove.png" alt="Heart Mozilla" title="What would you say, you do here?" class="photograph">Mozilla is an important, world-changing organization. It stands for a free and
open, privacy-minded, and user-centric Internet. [OKCupid encouraged users to switch browsers to send a message to Mozilla](http://www.cnet.com/news/okcupid-piles-on-mozilla-calls-for-new-ceo-to-resign/), with the entire notion of browser choice being reinvigorated by
Mozilla itself. The role of CEO is incredibly important to Mozilla; it
requires making tough choices and occasionally getting beat up by
[the press](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Adaringfireball.net+mozilla).

I think if Eich had apologized, expressed regret, and attempted to repair the
negative image painted of Mozilla (and his own image in the process), he
might still be CEO. He could've shown that he could put Mozilla first, that
he could swallow his pride to appear fair, and that he cared about the mission
more than preserving his privacy over a public donation.

So while the mob might feel like it won, proving that there is some kind of
zero-tolerance for homophobia in America, Eich's departure from Mozilla
tells a slightly more nuanced story than that.

**I'm not conflicted about this, even if it is saddening.** While I was hopeful
of Eich's ability to be our CEO, to lead us, and to be the face of Mozilla
as we launched ourselves into exciting new places, it was clear to me over the
past week or so that he was not suited to that role. I'm sad--deeply so--to
see him go. I wish it did not require him to leave Mozilla.

And while I was conflicted on having a Prop 8-supporting CEO, I was not
conflicted on having one who couldn't tackle an issue like this head-on.
