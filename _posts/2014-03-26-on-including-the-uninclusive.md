I work as a software developer at [Mozilla](https://mozilla.org/), so I
probably hang out in the "tech bubble" a bit more than I should. The world at
large has issues accepting pretty much anyone outside what it thinks is normal
and what it thinks is strong. On the social ladder, straight white men are at
the top, and it goes down from there. People fear what they don't understand;
they fear what they aren't. And those at the top try to keep their positions
by restricting the "other".

The problem with said restrictions, be they racism or sexism or homophobia or
xenophobia or whatever else, are hopefully evident to you. There's no evidence
that gays make lousy parents or women make bad programmers. Discounting
people out-of-hand is hurtful, and it limits some of the best and smartest
people because of hurtful, silly, preconceived notions. It's not right.

When you meet someone who is racist or homophobic or insensitive, you should
want to change their mind. You want to convince them of your world view; that
people of all types should have equal rights. That's good!

The way to do that is **not** to call them a bigot and dismiss them.

## Prop Eich

<img id="i-like-eich" src="{{ site.url }}/images/eich.jpg" alt="I like Eich pin." title="(Photo credit: Chris Lonnen)" class="photograph">Brendan Eich, the guy who wrote
JavaScript and has been a part of Mozilla since its inception,
[became Mozilla's CEO on Monday, March 24, 2014](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/03/24/mozilla-leadership-changes/).
A few years ago it came to light that he had
[donated $1,000 USD](http://projects.latimes.com/prop8/donation/8930/)
to a campaign against equal marriage for same-sex couples in California.

Brendan has since been painted as a homophobe, a bigot, intolerant, and many
in the Mozilla community have called for him to step down as CEO. Some have
said they will boycott Mozilla products and community while he is CEO.

It is entirely reasonable to feel that a CEO's actions in a community built on
openness and inclusiveness shouldn't be someone who wants to limit people's
rights, especially when they relate to private actions. Mozilla believes
greatly in people's right to privacy, and _who you're fucking_ is a pretty
private thing. It's ironic and troubling that our new CEO did not respect this
privacy, at least at one particular point.

## Open a Dialogue

It's important not to immediately cast off people who do wrong. If Eich is now
in a position of greater power at the company and in the community, people
should work to change his mind, not immediately condemn and dismiss him (like
he did to queers in 2008). The same goes for any person you meet who does
something wrong. You don't say "You're an idiot! You sexist pig!". You stop the
person, sit them down, and try to educate them. You say "What you did was
sexist, and here's why: ..."

It's not fair, but queer people are alienated in the minds of many straight
people; we're seen as deviants, immoral, or unwell. To alienate someone else
by calling them intolerant, instead of pointing out that one of their
_actions_ was intolerant, alienates them. It alienates you further in their
minds at the same time.

There is no forward progress in dismissing someone outright for one of their
traits. As the already alienated people, you should know this, and be better
than the person attacking you. You may not convince them by trying to open a
dialogue, but you will certainly not convince them by calling them a bigot
and putting them on the defensive.

<small>Some interesting side notes specifically regarding Eich, queers, and Mozilla:</small>

* <small>We [added trans benefits and a Code of Conduct](http://subfictional.com/2014/03/24/on-brendan-eich-as-ceo-of-mozilla) with Brendan in a leadership position.</small>
* <small>I have spoke to no queer Mozilla people who feel Eich has ever made them uncomfortable. I have never heard of Eich attacking homosexuals at Mozilla.</small>
* <small>Conversely, Gerv [posted a call to action against Gay marriage](http://blog.gerv.net/2012/03/coalition-for-marriage-petition/) to [Planet Mozilla](http://planet.mozilla.org/), which prompted the creation of a [Code of Conduct](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/) at Mozilla, which Eich worked on.</small>
* <small>Mozilla has amazing benefits for same-sex couples everywhere possible, including in many US states where it is not legally required.</small>
* <small>Mozilla as a company [donated more for equal marriage rights than against](http://projects.latimes.com/prop8/results/?position=both&name=&employer=mozilla&amount_min=&amount_max=&city=&state=&zip=&search=Search).</small>
