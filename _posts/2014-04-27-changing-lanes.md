Motorcycle crashes are nasty business. I've been in a few crashes and I've
always been able to walk away from them. Part of that is some skill as a rider,
and part of it is just luck. But a huge part is wearing gear that actually
protected me from the impact. In every crash I've been in, my legs have fared
the worst, because I almost always ride in jeans. I've also never been at
fault, but thanks to the way motorcycle crashes can go down--motorcyclists are
often left holding the bag. Here's what happened to me on April 16, 2014.

I headed over to a motorcycle shop in LaSalle to pick up one of
my motorcycles (a 2008 Aprilia Shiver). It wasn't the warmest day, but I was
excited to get riding again--even if I'd have to take it slow on the way home.
Unfortunately, I didn't get very far.

Two blocks away from the dealership, a car changed into my lane without
signalling. I crashed my motorcycle and the car drove off. A hit-and-run.

Worse than that: as I lay there on the ground, people behind me simply
drove on ahead instead of stopping to help me or see if I was okay. I managed
to flag down a pedestrian who helped me move my bike off the road (lifting a
naked bike off the street poses certain challenges as much of the exhaust and
engine are exposed).

Because no one who actually *saw* what happened stuck around, I didn't stick
around to file a police report on-site. Motorcycle crashes are absolutely
awful for the rider, even if they wind up coming out mostly okay as I did.
If you see a bike crash happen on the road: please help the rider. Crashing
feels awful, but having to get my bike off the street as cars continued to
zip around me was _worse_.

## All of the Gear, All of the Time?

This isn't the first motorcycle accident I've been in, but I've been fortunate
enough to never even break a bone from a crash. No doubt: the gear I wear has
protected me from a hell of a lot.

I'm not one of the folks who insist that all of the gear, all of the time is
the only way to ride. People ride bikes for all kinds of reasons, and it's up
to them to determine what level of protection they want. It's a trade-off too;
I wear leathers without armour because I find it lets me move better. Sometimes
I'll wear nothing but a shirt, gloves, and helmet on a hot summer day cruising
about in town. And I use my bike as a form of transportation; rarely do I
want to be wearing armoured, leather riding pants when I arrive at a restaurant.

Generally I'd advocate that always wearing a helmet and gloves is a smart
choice, and wearing at least jeans will protect you pretty well. I try my best
to wear my leather jacket as often as possible, and it's usually only rare,
warmer-than-35ÂºC summer days I'll go without it. It's saved my skin a
lot--literally--and I think it's meant I can not only get up from my crashes
but get right back to work afterward.

## The Gear

I wanted to review the gear I crashed in, talk about how well it stood up to
the crash, and whether I'd buy it again.

I'll skip my jacket, as it's a tailored, leather motorcycle jacket. It's safe
to say though: fashion leathers are not thick leathers. You want a fitted,
tough leather jacket if you're a biker. Textile jackets with armour are also
acceptable, but if you aren't wearing a jacket specifically built with
motorcycling in mind, you should at least be wearing thick leathers.

### My Helmet

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/nolan.jpg" alt="My Nolan N43E Trilogy" class="photograph">The helmet I was wearing was my 2012 Nolan N43E Trilogy, from
[Scooturismo Motorscooter Ltd.](http://www.scooturismo.com/) in Halifax, Canada.
It's a fancy helmet that has a **huge** visor, allowing for fantastic
field-of-view. This is really important, as I find many full-face helmets add
extra crash protection (passive protection) in the form of reduced
crash-prevention protection (ability to hear and see more around you). The large
visor on the Nolan is a nice meeting point between open and full face helmets.
It also has a removable chin-bar for those hot summer days when you want need
extra airflow.

The helmet stood up _fantastically_ to the crash; there's actually no extrernal
damage to the helmet, despite me spending thousands of kilometres riding in it
over the past few years. I took this helmet from Halifax to Montreal on my
Ducati 848 and it does the trick in cold and warm weather alike. My head hit
the ground hard enough to give me a bit of neck pain, but the helmet saved me
from having worse head injuries.

Of course, **if you crash in a helmet: it's time for a new one**. Your brain is
totally worth the $80-$400 most street helmets cost.

I would gladly buy another N43E Trilogy, though they're since stopped making
them and are now onto the
[N44](http://www.canadasmotorcycle.ca/nolan-n44-helmet.html). I'll have to
give it a look. Nolan make fantastic, and very versatile, helmets.

### My Gloves

Gloves are one of the most important and overlooked pieces of protective gear
you can wear on a bike. Breaking bones in your fingers or wrist, nevermind
getting horrible road rash, is easy as hell in a motorcycle accident.

I was wearing my [Alpinestars C-10 windproof gloves](http://www.canadasmotorcycle.ca/alpinestars-c-10-drystar-gloves.html). They have a hard knuckle on them, and those did an
**awesome** job. These gloves are fantastic outside their crash protection:
they're comfy, waterproof, warm, and windproof. They look pretty decent off
the bike as well. Great for a commuter.

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/c10.jpg" alt="My Alpinestars Gloves" class="photograph left">The leather in the palms suffered a fair bit, and I think it's safe to say
these are one-crash-gloves, but my hands aren't the least bit sore and suffered
zero road rash, so I'd say the gloves did a fantastic job.

I'll be getting another pair of these gloves for sure. Most of my gloves are
Icon, but I'll be giving Alpinestars a closer look in the future too.

### My Boots

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/x-street.jpg" alt="My motorbike shoes" class="photograph">I was wearing motorcycle riding shoes, in this case [TCX X-Street Waterproofs](http://www.canadasmotorcycle.ca/tcx-x-street-waterproof-leather-shoes.html). They look
like high-top sneakers, but they're waterproof, breathable, and very
protective. They've survived two motorcycle crashes and are still tough.
They're also the most comfortable motorcycle shoes I've owned. I won't need to
buy new ones, but I'm still very happy with the ones I have.

## Damage to Me

Largely, I'm okay. I was wearing denim jeans so my legs suffered some road
rash and muscle soreness, but for having a bike fall on me after kissing the
ground a bit with my legs, I did alright.

## Damage to the Bike

The bike simply fell over after the accident without a lot of sliding. It
didn't flip or roll at all, so the damage is minimal. It might need a new
handlebar, and there's definitely some cosmetic damage, but it shouldn't be
anything too bad.

## What To Do

Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if the car driver didn't even notice I went
down, given how little attention they were paying. In their rearview mirror
they wouldn't have seen me as I was on the ground. But no one else stopped or
tried to get the driver to stop. _Please_ look out for motorcycles on the road.

I know motorcyclists and car drivers don't always empathise with each other
very well. Motorcyclists are angry at cars for never looking and hurting us.
Car drivers are freaked out of aggressive bikers who filter poorly and ride
like the street is a race track.

If you see a motorcycle crash take place: **help the rider and do what they
say**. They'll be full of adreneline and might feel embarrassed, but they need
to **turn off the engine**, **move their bike off the street** (if possible),
**sit down** (assuming they can), and **call the cops**. Most motorcycle
accidents involve more bodily harm than damage to the bike, and even the most
expensive street bikes cost less than a nice Honda Civic.

## How To Avoid Crashes

The most obvious one is: **look for bikers**. The number of people I encounter
on the road who don't signal before changing lanes or turning is staggering.
These careless habits simply result in fender benders when two cars are
involved, but they are **very dangerous** to motorcycles. 75% of motorcycle
accidents involve a collision with another vehicle, and the [Hurt Report][hurt]
shows that _"The failure of motorists to detect and recognize motorcycles in
traffic is the predominating cause of motorcycle accidents."_

Be aware that in many places filtering or "lane splitting" is legal, but even
where it isn't strictly legal: it does happen. What's more, filtering has
been shown to relieve road congestion and be _much safer_ for motorcycle riders.
Treat the lanes on the road like they're intended to be treated and check your
blind spots.

And ultimately, remember that you're very protected and in a vehicle that does
a **lot** of things for you. Cars have traction control, cameras to help
backing in to driveways, ABS, power steering, and a wealth of other driver aids
motorcyclists don't. Take the extra second to signal while changing lanes, and
you might just save a motorcyclist's life.

If not their day and their bike.
