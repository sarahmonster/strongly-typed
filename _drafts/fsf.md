Though frankly Iâ€™m proud to work at Mozilla, where we can fight for users rather than solely ideals (like the FSF). https://t.co/cQQLxf95Bp

I'm happy that the Free Software Foundation exists and I think the work that
they do is important. It deeply affects me, as a believer in free software,
an open Internet, and user choice. Their work touches me every day--especially
in my daily use of GNU software, which makes Linux possibly.
