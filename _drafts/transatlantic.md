For the past year, my girlfriend and I have been exploring a move to the United Kingdom. While we were first thinking of moving to Spain, we decided on the UK for a few reasons. Sarah is a British citizen by birth, so moving to anywhere in the EU was possible. You'd think her being British would make it easier for us to move to the UK than to any other EU country. But: you'd be wrong!

Getting a visa to live in another country is rarely a straightforward process. Hell, getting a visitor visa for lots of places is a pain. I knew applying for a UK settlement visa would be hard. And before I started I wasn't sure if I even qualified to apply. This is because my girlfriend is self-employed. The UKVI is unclear on the rules for British citizens self-employed outside the UK.

## The UK and Immigration

You can find plenty of stories about a United Kingdom flooded by immigrants or about a London where no one speaks English anymore. These views are sensationalist to say the least. Open borders with poorer, Eastern European countries is supplying cheap, labour--both skilled and unskilled. I've held a pro-immigration, anti-border stance before I was an immigrant. The fight against immigration is one that wins votes, but rarely makes economic sense. (Unless your current market is so fucked you need massive protectionism.) I am *transferring* my position at Mozilla to the UK, so I'm **creating** a job there. And my girlfriend is bringing her business, doing the same.

The UK has been fighting net migration, trying to reduce immigration. Being part of the EU, the UK cannot limit EU nationals from entering. Thus: the easiest group to limit admittance from is non-EU nationals.

In 2012 UK Parliament updated immigration rules for British citizens with non-EU spouses. British citizens [must make at least £18,600/year](http://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jul/11/appeal-court-18600-foreign-spouse-uk) to sponsor their partners. Fortunately, my girlfriend makes enough to meet this rule. We're great immigrants as we're both creating new jobs in the UK.

But illustrating this fact was not as easy as stating what we make and getting the visa. If your sponsor (the British citizen) lives and works in the UK, the process is easy. Even if your sponsor is self-employed in the UK, the process isn't hard.

But if you're a British citizen working outside the UK, you'll need more documentation. A **lot** more.

That said, it is _possible_ to apply when both people are outside the UK. That wasn't even clear to me when I started. Here's how I did it:

## Self-Employment Evidence

First thing's first: the self-employed sponsor should be able to "move" their business. Without the intent to move their business, UK Immigration will refuse your application. Proving this is as simple as indicating it in a letter, but it's important to mention.

You're also going to need to make at least £18,600. You must convert any non-pound amounts to GBP. You must do this at [oanda.com](http://www.oanda.com/currency/converter/). To add to the annoyance: you must use exchange rate on the day you got the money. Have fun with that if you have lots of deposits!

I hope you kept good business records! Next up you'll need to prove your business makes money. Print out your bank statements for the last two fiscal years in your country. Then highlight **every deposit** and link it to an invoice. Afterward, find every transfer from your business account to your personal bank account. This is to prove your business pays you.

Finally, make sure you include your business's registration papers.

If you follow these steps, you'll meet the financial requirement set by the UK even though you aren't employed in the UK!

## The rest of the process

The rest of the process is the same: you can see the rules on [Gov.uk][]. Some of the wording on the site makes it seem like your partner being outside the UK excludes you. It doesn't; applying from outside the UK is fine. Your British sponsor is "living in the UK permanently" as long as they're a citizen. Even if they have **never lived in the UK** and **don't even have a National Insurance number** they qualify. [Gov.uk][] and several visa guides do not make this clear but it is the case.

If you're living with your British partner, you just need evidence of this. I used our joint chequing account (the only joint account we have) and our own credit card bills with a matching address. You'll also need a few photos of you together.

## Should I use a visa company?

I can't speak for all visa companies or lawyers, but I can say I used one and am happy I did. That said, I did because I could afford it and I had **no idea what I was doing** when I started this process. If my situation were less complicated I might have even done it on my own. I would say even if you know the rules, using a visa company will save you some stress.

It isn't cheap: I paid £980 using [1st Contact Visas](http://www.1stcontactvisas.com/united-kingdom/spousal-partner-visa.aspx). They sped up the process, were super attentive, and offered a money-back deal if the UK refused me a visa. If you can afford it I'd recommend it, but if you can't at least you know you can use non-UK self-employment to apply.

## More to come

I can't find a lot of straightforward, first-hand accounts of moving to the UK from Canada. Especially not recent ones. I plan on writing more about shipping my motorcycle, moving furniture, and getting bank accounts. I'll try to recommend good companies along the way, as I did with 1st Contact.
