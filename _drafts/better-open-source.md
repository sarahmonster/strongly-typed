I was listening to the [Cracked Podcast][] today, and they mentioned that
any personal successful enough that you know about also knows about you.
In other words: they realized they had to market themselves a certain way and
present themselves a certain way to have people pay attention to them. Read
the diaries of even a supposed misanthrope like Kurt Cobain and you see he was
incredibly concious of his band's behaviour and image--despite their motto
seemingly being one of "we don't give a damn".

Caring about the way your open source project looks to the world will make
all the difference when it comes to getting contributions from casual users
and not just people with a vested interest in the library.

## Where it all began

I've been working on [localForage][] for the past few months, and I've picked
up some new skills that I didn't expect to pick up. I figured working on the
library would teach me more about persistent storage in JavaScript, but it
turns out I've learned a lot about creating better open source projects, from
managing issues and people to making sure the library is as inviting to new
contributors as is possible. I don't think localForage is that amazing of a
concept, nor do I think it's so revolutionary that it took off simply because
it's The Most Amazing Thing Everâ„¢. Rather, I think localForage took off
because it's an **inviting**, well-documented, and well-maintained open source
project that encourages **automated tests**, **community ownership**, and
discourages **nitpicking** and **insider knowledge**.

My friend [sole][] [pointed out a lot of things][sole-talk] [our team][]
could do to create better, more successful open source projects. In this
context, I think success is not only lots of users of our software, but
contributors *to* our software. As she gave her presentation, I realized
the reasons localForage has so many [contributions][] from community members
were all things sole was advocating in her presentation. There were a few
things I wasn't doing yet, but it made me think about fostering open source
projects.

So what can you do to write an open source project that will not only garner
people's interests, but also their contributions? Here are the things that have
worked for me, without fail:
