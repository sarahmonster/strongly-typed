Strongly Typed is an occasional exercise in writing by [me, Matthew Riley MacPherson](http://lonelyvegan.com). I think about certain things--code, coffee, development, motorcycle gear, and travel--often, so I wanted a soapbox on which to shout about them.

## About Me, Matthew Riley MacPherson

<img src="/images/matt-techshop.jpg" alt="A photo of me" id="about-me-photo" class="about-photo">I'm a twenty-five year-old web developer and motorcycle junkie living in Montreal, Canada. I work at Mozilla on web apps. I write apps, work to discover best practices, and teach others how to write great software with standards-based technology.

I'm originally from a [tiny city](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney,_Nova_Scotia) on an [island famed for a trail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Breton_Island) off the Atlantic Ocean. I grew up mostly [in Canada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary) (and a bit [in the United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln,_Nebraska)) and moved to [Halifax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halifax_Regional_Municipality) when I was eighteen. I [took a summer job](http://novascotia.ca/) as a "web development intern" which was extended to a nearly four year tenure.

### Motorcycles

In 2011 I bought a brand-new Ducati 848 and [did some crazy stuff on it](http://triggersandsparks.com/blog/how-a-motorcycle-made-me-a-better-businessperson/). Slightly before I bought the Ducati I [started seeing a girl](http://twitter.com/sarahsemark), so I can't blame the cool bike for that.

I later moved to [Montreal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal) despite not knowing French or that the [PQ would win an election](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_general_election,_2012). Shortly after I arrived my Ducati 848 was stolen from my home and I found a new love in vintage cafe racers (specifically a [1976 Honda 400 Four](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_CB400F), pictured above). I also own an [Aprilia Shiver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aprilia_SL_750_Shiver), which I bought after I missed owning Italian things with two cylinders that go fast.

### Travel

I started to travel much more after joining Mozilla, having since visited a fair share of Canada and the USA, while racking up passport stamps from a few other continents. I, as mentioned, rode my motorcycle over 3,000 kilometres in one weekend for fun, then flew across North America as soon as I returned home. I am particularly fond of Bangkok for its mix of Thai food and [farang-friendly Jazz bars](https://foursquare.com/v/the-iron-fairies--co/4bd98c220115c9b67da47780).

### Other Pursuits

I'm thoroughly interested in slightly obscure aspects of the world like citizenship laws or the politics of language. I am fascinated by the pace of globalization that technology has enabled. I less often think more regulation is the right answer, but I'm not convinced that government is an evil thing that must be eradicated.

I also, like most nerds with enough disposable income, obsess a fair deal over coffee.
