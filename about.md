title: About Strongly Typed

Strongly Typed is an occasional exercise in writing by [me, Matthew Riley MacPherson](http://tofumatt.com). I think about certain things--code, coffee, development, motorcycle gear, and travel--often, so I wanted a soapbox on which to shout about them.

## About Me, Matthew Riley MacPherson

I'm a twenty-six year-old web developer and motorcycle junkie living in Montreal, Canada. I work at Mozilla on web apps. I write apps, work to discover best practices, and teach others how to write great software with standards-based technology.

I'm originally from a [tiny city](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney,_Nova_Scotia) on an [island famed for a trail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Breton_Island) off the Atlantic Ocean. I grew up mostly [in Canada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary) (and a bit [in the United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln,_Nebraska)) and moved to [Halifax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halifax_Regional_Municipality) when I was eighteen. I [took a summer job](http://novascotia.ca/) as a "web development intern" which was extended to a nearly four year tenure.

### Motorcycles

In 2011 I bought a brand-new Ducati 848 and [did some crazy stuff on it](http://triggersandsparks.com/blog/how-a-motorcycle-made-me-a-better-businessperson/). Slightly before I bought the Ducati I [started seeing a girl](http://twitter.com/sarahsemark), so I can't blame the cool bike for that.

I later moved to [Montreal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal) despite not knowing French or that the [PQ would win an election](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_general_election,_2012).

I thoroughly enjoy vintage cafe racers (specifically a
[1976 Honda 400 Four](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_CB400F), pictured
above).

### Travel

I started to travel much more after joining Mozilla. I am particularly fond of
Bangkok for its mix of Thai food and [farang-friendly Jazz bars][if].

### Other Pursuits

Like most nerds with enough disposable income, I obsess over coffee. My
favourite brew method is tied between pulling a shot of espresso and pouring
a cup of Hario V60 brew coffee.
